Aging is a substrate for the development of many chronic diseases worldwide. Age-related diseases and syndromes pose a growing challenge to healthcare systems worldwide, resulting in poor quality of life and poor health in the later stages of life. Intervening in the molecular effects of aging can prevent or delay the onset of many diseases. In this context, geroprotectants aim to regulate the underlying molecular mechanisms of these age-related diseases with a single pharmacological intervention, as demonstrated in animal models. Therefore, machine learning and chemoinformatics can be used to search for new compounds with geroprotective properties. This study analysed the Geroprotectors database containing many compounds with geroprotective activity. Three Machine Learning models, Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Nearest Neighbors (KNN), were built to predict whether or not compounds have desired geroprotective effects, using chemical descriptors calculated from the chemical structure of each compound as features. We applied our model to predict compounds with possible geroprotective activity in the Coconut database, where the geroprotective activity of natural compounds hosted in this database is unknown.
